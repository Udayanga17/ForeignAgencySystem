# ForeignAgencySystem
diploma final project

# Project Overview
This system is designed to digitize and streamline the recruitment process of an overseas employment agency, with a focus on recruiting welders for Korean job opportunities. It replaces the existing manual processes with a structured, role-based digital solution that allows employees to register clients, manage evaluations, process payments, and track visa statuses efficiently.

# System Interfaces
The system includes multiple user interfaces tailored to specific roles within the organization:

1. Employee Registration
Admins register employees based on their job roles and assign a unique employee number, username, and password.

2. Employee Login
Employees securely log in using their credentials to access role-specific system functionalities.

3. Client Registration
Registration clerks register clients and assign a unique client number for tracking throughout the recruitment process.

4. Job Role Selection
Clients choose their desired job role during registration. The system validates their qualifications before allowing role-specific registration.

5. Welder Registration
Clients applying as welders must submit an FCAW certificate, 2-year work experience letter, and a valid passport. Upon validation, they are issued a welder ID.

6. Upload Test Dates
Coordinators and managing clerks upload scheduled dates for local, Korean, and medical tests.

7. Local Test Request
Registration clerks manage local test requests and view test attempt history (up to 3 attempts allowed).

8. Upload Local Test Results
Office clerks upload results of the local welding test, including previous attempt grades if available.

9. Korean Test Request
After passing the local test, clients request to take the Korean welding test. Their local test result is verified prior to the request.

10. Upload Korean Test Results
Office clerks upload the Korean test results, with support for viewing previous attempts.

11. Advance Payment
Payment clerks collect advance payments from welders who have passed the Korean test and meet training requirements.

12. Medical Test Request
Managing clerks initiate medical test requests. Welders are allowed up to 2 attempts.

13. Upload Medical Test Results
Medical test results are uploaded by the managing clerk, with visibility into previous attempt results if applicable.

14. Update Visa Status
Visa approval or rejection is updated in the system using the welder ID.

15. Post-Recruitment Issues
The managing clerk logs any issues clients face while abroad, ensuring ongoing support through Korean agents.


 Current Operations (Before System Implementation)
 
Previously, the Royal Green Agency handled operations manually:

Client Registration

Clients submitted personal details manually and received a registration number.

Job Role Selection

Clients selected job roles after a manual orientation. Required qualifications were checked on paper.

Evaluation Tests

Test bookings, filtering pass/fail results, and tracking attempts were all done manually.

Visa Process

Entire visa and flight ticket processing was handled manually, including document submission.

Payment Handling

Staff manually tracked payments for tests, training, and visa processing.

Post-Recruitment Tracking

Client issues abroad were tracked informally through manual records and phone calls.

Company Accounting

Employee salaries, tax payments, and bills were handled using manual accounting methods.


This system replaces those manual methods with automated, secure, and role-based operations, improving accuracy, traceability, and efficiency across all recruitment phases.
